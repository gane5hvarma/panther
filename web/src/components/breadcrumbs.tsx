// @HELP_WANTED
// resource names can get super big. We wanna guard against that. Normally we would just say
// that the name should be truncated to the width it fits in, but there is a problem in our case.
// What happens if we go to "/policies/<BIG_TEXT>/edit"? You would be seeing
// "/policies/<BIG_TEXT....>" and you would never be able to see that last part of the breadcrumbs
// that contains the word "edit". To guard against that, we are saying that the biggest breacrumb
// will be a fixed amount of px so that there is *always* space for some other stuff. This is a
// *hardcoded behaviour* meant to guard us against the resource & policy details pages and the number
// assigned to `maxWidth` is special so thaat it can cover our possible breadcrumb combinations when
// a breadcrumb contains a resourceID or a policyID within it. I can't think of any other solution
// that can fit our usecase that doesn't involve complex JS calculations, so please help out
