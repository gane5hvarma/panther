# API Definitions
Panther has several different APIs managing different kinds of data. This folder contains the
Swagger api specs and Go clients/models which services need to communicate with an API.

There is an ongoing effort to unify and simplify the Panther API, but for now there are 2
different API implementations:

* [lambda/](lambda) [DEPRECATED] - Invoking a Lambda function directly as an API, using the [genericapi](../pkg/genericapi) library.
These APIs are defined purely by Go request/response models.
* [gateway/](gateway) - API Gateway proxies requests to a Lambda function, assisted by the [gatewayapi](../pkg/gatewayapi) library.
These APIs define the Swagger specification and the autogenerated Go client/models.

In either case, the Lambda function ultimately manages data in an underlying data store, usually DynamoDB.

## Building
To generate the Go client/models packages from Swagger files, run `mage build:api` from the repo root.
